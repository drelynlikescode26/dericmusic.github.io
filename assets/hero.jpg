PLACEHOLDER: This file is a placeholder for the hero image.

Replace this file with the attached portrait image and name it exactly `hero.jpg`.

To replace from macOS Finder or terminal:

mv /path/to/your/downloaded/image.jpg "assets/hero.jpg"

Or from terminal where the repo is located:

cp /Users/you/Downloads/portrait.jpg "assets/hero.jpg"

If you'd like, upload the image here and I will replace this placeholder with the real image for you.
